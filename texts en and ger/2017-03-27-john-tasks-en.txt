To view this shared file, go to: jsonerrors.txt
take this file and take the JSON errors out and make them more readable.  These are output from Ajv schema validation.  We just want the error messages more readable
Let us know if JSON.stringify is good enough

You'll have to use wordpad
 
maybe try JSON.stringify and see what you get
We can also perhaps sell to Ajv people


make it just more readable and understandable

you need to take the JSON and run it through a program to produce pretty printed errors
 So you take the JSON, run it through Ajv, which produces JSON, which you run through your code to produce better messages, colored output etc
 

we are converting the JSON to X3DOM and X3D XML (Cobweb)
I wonder if we can sell this as an in app purchase


A follow on task will be to create nicely formatted HTML5 popup for the errors (but I will probably do that :)
An important thing is to NOT miss any errors as this may be an JavaScript injection issue, and we want the user to be forced to be notified of any JavaScript injection issues.
so it may be interesting to create some test cases which show JavaScript injection
we are converting the JSON to X3DOM and X3D XML (Cobweb)

 If you do this task well, I may ask you to highlight or go to the place in the original json (not the error) where the error occured and perhaps provide a tooltip
 Or list the errors on the page.   See jsonlint for an example.
 
 highlighting errors would be more useful, and more of a product.
I might be able to sell that
but I think the first step is getting the JSON error in a form where we can process it
1) location 2) offending operation 3) offending parameter or constraint

https://jsonschemalint.com/#/version/draft-04/markup/json


To see how messages appear now, go to http://coderextreme.net/X3DJSONLD/ and select force.json.   a pop-up will appear.  We want to do something better than that pop-up.   We probably don't want to show the JSON file until that pop-up is confirmed.

  I only want you to process the ....errors field, which is JavaScript or parsed JSON
   You don't have to deal with JSON parsing errors, but they are intermixed unfortunately
   So just focus on additional property, missing property, constraints, limits and values and JS path that includes the property

    Ajv produces the ...errors field on one of the objects

days ago when u gave me that task, u wrote I shall use wordpad and u also said that it is about json errors to make them more readable
Is it that I shall process validation errors instead of parsing errors?
why u said I shall use wordpad? thats why i wrote that many text when u said that would be to overcomplicated

what if Ajv output changes with another verion? then the text processing would be needed to be rewritten
which of my ideas in that big text would u recommend and which not

What you should do is introduce errors in existing files

schema files:
https://github.com/coderextreme/x3dvalidate/blob/master/x3d-3.3-JSONSchema.json

Don't worry, the task is still there.  Did you check out the x3dvalidate project, or are you unable to?
$ git clone https://github.com/coderextreme/x3dvalidate
cd x3dvalidate$ npm install


meteor project, so you can run it under cmd?

meteor is a javascript building and dev tool for deploying new versions to the browser.  We don't have a browser in this case, but we could build a simple web page
Like a textarea where you could paste and edit JSON, select a schema version, and press the validate button
meteor takes the place of express

function instead of extra program
nicht den ganzen strom, sondern einzelne messages, nicht mehrere, z.B. 80 Chars
ein mal für parser und ein mal für validator
JSON.parse() and Ajv,  JSON.stringify
There's also output from the JSON.parse which is separate and not JSON
We can use jsonlint for good messages from a JSON parse

Go ahead and fork this project: https://github.com/coderextreme/x3dvalidate
The try catch in index.js should be split into two, one for JSON.parse and one for Ajv
JSON examples are here: http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dExampleArchivesJsonScenes.zip

You'll have to try X3DJSONLD. Load flipper.json or force.json http://coderextreme.net/X3DJSONLD/ https://github.com/coderextreme/X3DJSONLD/

There's a problem with the current version of ajv
use 4.11.7


you can look at Ajv for what it returns in errs[e]Gesendet am:19:56Von:John Carlsonin particular, you want to look at all the varieties of errs[e].message

if jsonlint fails, JSON will work for a parser.
I found a problem with jsonlint
jsonlint has better messages

You may want to split off the jsonlint error messages from the Ajv messages
so they aren't in the same try catch

go ahead and make the index.js an index.ts file if you like, but be sure to add instructions on how to run it
It wasn't a bug in my code, it was that you were using node 4.
